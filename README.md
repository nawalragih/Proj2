# Driveway Management System Project

## Description
This project is a Node.js-based driveway management system that handles client requests for quotes, allows workers (referred to as "David") to accept, reject, or negotiate the proposed prices, and generates bills for accepted orders. The system uses MySQL for data storage and manages sessions with user authentication.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have:
- Node.js installed on your system.
- MySQL database running.
- Access to the MySQL server with necessary privileges.
